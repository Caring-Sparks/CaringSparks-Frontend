## Common Themes Across All Case Studies

### 1. Trust Over Fame
Micro-influencers build trust through familiarity, not celebrity status.

### 2. Distributed Risk
1,000 small voices are safer and more resilient than one loud voice.

### 3. Community Empowerment
Income distribution, youth empowerment, and gender equality.

### 4. Authentic Recommendations
People copy people like themselves, not celebrities.

### 5. Sustainable Growth
Slow, steady growth allows for feedback, iteration, and quality maintenance.

### 6. Local Context
Nigerian creators speaking to Nigerian audiences with cultural understanding.
