# Case Studies Update - Real ThePrGod Content

## What Changed

I've replaced the placeholder case studies with your actual 4 comprehensive case studies that showcase ThePrGod's micro-influencer marketing approach.

## The 4 Case Studies

### 1. Celebrity Marketing: The $350,000 Question
**Focus:** Wizkid & Pepsi campaign analysis

Compares the impact of spending $350,000 on one celebrity (Wizkid for Pepsi) versus distributing that same budget across 1,000 micro-influencers at $350 each. 

**Key Insights:**
- Celebrity endorsements create attention; micro-influencers create adoption
- People copy people like themselves, not celebrities
- Distributed income empowers communities and aligns with SDGs
- Growing brands need controlled growth, not explosive attention

### 2. Winning Elections: Why Micro-Influencers Are Safer
**Focus:** Political campaigns in Nigeria

Examines how celebrity political endorsements backfired for Portable, Davido, Eniola Badmus, Toyin Abraham, and Iyabo Ojo, leading to cancellation, bullying, and systemic consequences.

**Key Insights:**
- Celebrity influence in politics comes with invisible costs
- Micro-influencers are structurally protected from cancellation
- Risk distribution across many voices vs one celebrity
- Local, relatable messengers beat elite symbols

### 3. My Startup App is Ready. How Do I Find My First Customer?
**Focus:** Startup growth strategy

Addresses the painful gap between launching an app and finding the first customer who will trust an unknown brand.

**Key Insights:**
- Building an app is a trust challenge, not just technical
- Traditional marketing (ads, press, large influencers) fails early
- Micro-influencers provide authenticity and valuable feedback
- Slow, steady growth leads to stronger products

### 4. Getting People Into Your Walk-In Store
**Focus:** Physical businesses (nightclubs, restaurants, salons)

Shows why digital presence alone doesn't work for walk-in businesses and how micro-influencers remove the psychological barriers to entry.

**Key Insights:**
- The biggest barrier is psychological: fear of walking in
- Pricing transparency qualifies the right audience
- Micro-influencers translate brand language into human language
- People need to know if they belong, what it costs, and what to expect
